# canvas

Playing around with canvas.


## Some goals

- How do you allow the canvas to scale with window size?
- How do you allow the contents of the canvas to scale and not blur?
- Does ClojureScript make working with this stuff easier?
- How do you represent objects?
- How do you animate?
- How do you best use requestAnimation?
- How "functional" can you make all this?
